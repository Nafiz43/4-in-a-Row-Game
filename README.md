# 4-in-a-Row-Game

Design of Game board:
For designing the game board, we have taken a two dimensional vector of integer. Human agent will put ‘1’ on the board and AI agent will put ‘2’ on the board. Later on, while representing, ‘1’ is converted to ‘O’ and ‘2’ is converted to ‘X’. We have considered standard board size in this game which is 6x7.
